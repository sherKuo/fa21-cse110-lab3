**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The current website is incredibly bare and lacking in style. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The website should have color, diverse fonts and look more exciting with styling. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've considered playing with spacing but the use can only make so much of a distance.

**Additional context**
Screenshots of before and after will be fun.
