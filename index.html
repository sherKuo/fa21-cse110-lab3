                        in students and teachers. Students will study well to crack <br>
                        the annual exams, and teachers will take the responsibility 
                        to make their students capable of getting promoted to the next class.<br>
                        Thereby the quality of education will be improved.

                <p class="inline-block">Five high school students from different walks of life endure a 
                    Saturday detention under a power-hungry principal. The disparate <br>
                    group includes rebel John, princess Claire, outcast Allison, 
                    brainy Brian and Andrew, the jock. Each has a chance to tell his <br>
                    or her story, making the others see them a little differently 
                    -- and when the day ends, they question whether school will ever <br>
                    be the same.</p>

                            Throughout the film, the different characters are in conflict 
                            with each other -- mostly because they come from different social <br>
                            & economic groups.   For example, the verbal and psychological 
                            conflict between John and Claire is the result of their very  <br>
                            different class backgrounds.  Another important conflict shown in 
                            the film is that between John and the teacher responsible for  <br>
                            detention. An underlying conflict is that between each of the students 
                            and their parents.

                    <p>
                        The interaction between the five members of the Breakfast Club is full 
                        of examples of cooperation.  The five work together to sneak through <br>
                        the hallways and avoid detection.  They try to cover for John after he 
                        returns to the library via the ceiling passageway.  Brian agrees to <br> 
                        write the paper to represent the other four members of the group.  The 
                        dance scenes near the end of the movie are also examples of cooperation <br>
                        - as the students work together to have fun and blow off steam after an 
                        emotionally draining day of detention.
